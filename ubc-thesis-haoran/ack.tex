\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I offer my enduring gratitude to Dr. Rachel Pottinger, whose inspiration, encouragement, and technical expertise helped me greatly in my studies. I also thank my fellow students Zainab Zolaktaf, Omar AlOmeir, Mostafa Milani, and Glenn Bevilacqua for their suggestions and mentorship in this field of research.

Special thanks are owed to my parents, whose support throughout my years of education, both morally and financially, made me a confident individual capable of succeeding in my future endeavours.
