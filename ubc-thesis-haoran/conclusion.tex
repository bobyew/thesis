Data in the modern computing landscape needs to be managed by multiple users, and the complexity of data schema has grown to an extent that no single user can understand every detail. When a user needs to understand data not managed by him or her, we proposed attach semantics-rich metadata (especially the metadata tags) to each separate data instance, which serves as a summary of the data. We first reviewed a number of works related to data summarization, searching data, and comparing data by matching, we then discussed how the metadata tags with enriched semantics provide more evidence and context to these works. We aimed to solve the issue of incompleteness in a repository containing open data, and then developed an iterative approach that augments the metadata of tabular data in open data. We made assumptions that allow us to augment metadata in a pay-as-you-go fashion, where we only augmented tags for tables related to a given base table. We showed that our algorithm outperforms baseline algorithm, but also indicated many areas we still need improvement as future work.
