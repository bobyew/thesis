\chapter{Lay Summary}

In large repositories where many tables are related to each other and each table contains rich data contents, there is usually not enough information to describe the contents of each table and how the tables are related to each other. Existing repositories use the metadata of a table created by the authors to help users and computer programs to better understand the contents in the table, but they are often unable to fully describe the contents and the relatedness among tables. Open Data is one type of repository that exhibits such characteristics. We propose approaches to solve the issue by augmenting existing metadata with additional tags such that more tags describe the contents of each table, and relatedness is captured by overlapping tags among tables. Our work is within the research area of heterogeneous metadata management for building data integration systems. Our work contributes to improving the data-to-knowledge pipeline for big data.
